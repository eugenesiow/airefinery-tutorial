    "# Getting Started with the Flow Super Agent using the AI Refinery SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook is a beginner-friendly guide to using the Accenture AI Refinery SDK to orchestrate a complex workflow with a **Flow Super Agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the `DistillerClient` to manage a group of `UtilityAgent`s whose interactions are defined by a deterministic workflow. We will walk through setting up this multi-agent system to create a simple stock investment advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Flow Super Agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `FlowSuperAgent` is a powerful component in the AI Refinery SDK that manages other agents. Its logic is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each node is a utility agent (like a researcher or a writer) and the connections between them define the flow of information. This structure allows for complex tasks to be broken down and even processed in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the AI Refinery SDK?\n",
    "The AI Refinery SDK is a toolkit that makes it easier for developers to build and use powerful AI agents. It handles the complex parts of connecting to and interacting with large AI models, so you can focus on building your application. The `DistillerClient` is a key component that orchestrates how different agents work together to solve a task."
