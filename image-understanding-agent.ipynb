    "# Getting Started with Image Understanding using the AI Refinery SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook is a beginner-friendly guide to using the Accenture AI Refinery SDK for a common and powerful task: **Image Understanding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the `DistillerClient`, which allows for building complex, multi-agent systems. We will walk through setting up a simple configuration to use the powerful, single-purpose **Image Understanding Agent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Image Understanding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image understanding, or Visual Question Answering (VQA), is a fascinating AI capability where you can ask a question about an image in plain English. The AI model \"sees\" the image and provides a text-based answer. For example, you could show it a picture of a city street and ask, \"*How many cars are in this image?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the AI Refinery SDK?\n",
    "The AI Refinery SDK is a toolkit that makes it easier for developers to build and use powerful AI agents. It handles the complex parts of connecting to and interacting with large AI models, so you can focus on building your application. The `DistillerClient` is a key component that orchestrates how different agents work together to solve a task."
